# <Week 1 Challenge>

## Description
My motivation to do this project was getting into the tech world officially, I have always liked tech but this is defenitely the deepest I have gotten into it. Building this project was incredibly satisfying and it taught so much more about coding and web developmnent. It solved so many questions that I previously had and and showed me just how deep you can get into tech, even though this is only the beginning. Overall my experience was great and can't wait to keep going forward and learning even more that I already have.
